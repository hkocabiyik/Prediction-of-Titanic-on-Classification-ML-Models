# Prediction-of-Titanic-on-Classification-ML-Models
### Prediction Analysis by classification ML models in Titanic Data Set to submit to Kaggle Competition. 
#### The Titanic passenger list can be used for an exercise classification task: Given the data of a new passenger, we want to predict whether they will survive the disaster.

- Work through the following steps:

- Explore the Titanic dataset

- Train a Logistic Regression classification model

- Create features using one-hot encoding

- Calculate the train and validation accuracy

- Train a Random Forest classification model

- Submit the predictions to Kaggle

- Upload your code to GitHub
